# sWADAH

## Introduction

**sWADAH** is a Malaysian-made Digital Institutional Repository (DIR) system that is easy to use and configure.

## Development

The development of this DIR began in 2009, starting from our **iSYS engine**. Over the past 10 years, we have spent countless hours developing our own DIR to support the latest advancements in software development. This effort stems from the fact that systems like **Eprints** and **DSpace** are often not user-friendly and can be complicated to install.

Developed using **PHP**, **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, and **MariaDB**, sWADAH's codebase is easy to understandâ€”even for those with minimal programming knowledge. Users can easily fork their own version of sWADAH and customize it endlessly.
